# git-workshop-slides
Slides from a workshop on an introduction to Git and GitHub

To view the slides, download or clone the repository, then look at the four `html` files. They cover:
1. Basics, such as repositories, commits, and the three trees
2. Reset and moving HEAD
3. Branches, merges, and merge conflicts
4. Using Github, collaboration, and pull requests

There are some useful links at the end of Part 4, repeated here for convenience:
